Developed a predictive model for graduate admissions based on academic and experiential attributes.
•	Dataset: Analyzed 400 samples with 8 attributes (GRE, TOEFL, University rating, SOP, LOR, CGPA, Research, Chance of admit).
•	Exploratory Data Analysis: Detected and removed outliers in LOR, CGPA, and Chance of Admission. Correlation analysis revealed high correlation of GRE, TOEFL scores, and CGPA with COA.
•	Model Selection: Chose Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) for its suitability in predicting a continuous dependent variable.
•	Results: Achieved MAE of 0.0535, MSE of 0.0058, and RMSE of 0.0765. The model explained 82.03% of variance in admission chances.
•	Key Insights: Demonstrated positive contributions of GRE, TOEFL, LOR, CGPA, and Research to the chance of admission. Validated model reliability through residual analysis and Q-Q plots. Achieved a Multiple R-Squared value of 0.8203, explaining 82.03% of the variance in admission chances.
